# DSA Learning Repository

Welcome to my DSA Learning repository! This is a personal project where I am learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Love babbar sheet and solving various questions to improve my problem-solving skills. The repository contains a collection of algorithms, data structures, and solutions to different coding problems.

## Introduction

This repository contains the solutions to various DSA problems I am solving as part of my learning process. As I progress in my learning journey, I plan to cover fundamental concepts and more advanced topics in DSA. Each solution is organized by the type of problem, and I aim to make the explanations and solutions as clear and efficient as possible.

## Learning Goals

- Understand fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, etc.).
- Solve algorithmic problems using time and space optimization techniques.
- Master problem-solving techniques like dynamic programming, backtracking, and greedy algorithms.
- Write clean, readable, and efficient code with proper documentation.

## DSA Topics Covered

1. **Arrays**
   - Basic operations (insertion, deletion, search)
   - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
   - Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)

2. **Linked Lists**
   - Singly Linked List
   - Doubly Linked List
   - Circular Linked List

3. **Stacks and Queues**
   - Stack operations (push, pop, peek)
   - Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)
   - Implementing stacks and queues using arrays and linked lists

4. **Trees**
   - Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST)

## Problem Solving Approach

For each problem, I follow a structured approach to solving it:

1. **Understand the problem:** Carefully read the problem statement and constraints.
2. **Plan the solution:** Choose an appropriate algorithm or data structure that best fits the problem.
3. **Write the code:** Implement the solution in a clean, modular, and efficient way.
4. **Test and optimize:** Test the solution with different test cases, including edge cases. Optimize for time and space complexity.

## How to Use

- Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/rish672003/Practice.git`
- Navigate to the directory of the problem you're interested in.
- Read the problem statement and the provided solution.
- Feel free to modify and practice the problems by implementing your own solutions.
